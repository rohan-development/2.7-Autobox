# Autobox
A project that automatically shifts bicycle gears.
The autobox uses a servo motor to pull on the derailleur cable of a bicycle, allowing it to change gears. Input is provided through a reed switch and magnet, allowing the device to keep the cadence (pedalling speed) relatively constant.

See attached Report.pdf for details.
